# Python Blackjack Game

## Author: Jared Kroke

Fairly self-explanatory. A simple project which simulates a replayable game of blackjack between a single player and the dealer, using a single deck.  A fun beginner program 
I created to practice my python skills and work on general programming ability.  Utilizes the python random library for shuffling the deck.
